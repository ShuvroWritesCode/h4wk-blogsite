Hey everyone! I’ve been learning about AWS cloud security through [Cybr](https://cybr.com/courses/aws-certified-security-specialty-scs-c02-course/), and I put together some notes during my learning journey. These started out as raw notes, but I’ve polished them up to make them easier to follow. In this blog, I’ll share tips on securing an AWS user account with best practices. Hope you find it helpful!

First things first, you’ll need to create a new AWS account. When you set it up, you’ll automatically be logged in as the root user. However, for security reasons, it’s crucial to switch away from using the root account right away.

You should almost never use the root user except in very rare cases where it’s absolutely necessary. For details on when `root` access is required, check out this [link](https://cybr.com/courses/aws-certified-security-specialty-scs-c02-course/lessons/secure-the-root-user/#:~:text=to%20be%20used%2C-,view%20here,-.%20Outside%20of%20those).

## Securing root

Following the [AWS Well-Architectured Framework](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/getting-started.html) and its security pillars, you can take the following steps to secure the `root` user.

1. **Use a Strong Password:** Choose a long, strong password. Tools like **Bitwarden** can help generate and manage secure passwords.

2. **Check Access Keys:** Ensure there are no access keys linked to the root user. For new accounts, this shouldn’t be an issue.

3. **Enable MFA:** Set up Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for added security. A hardware MFA device is ideal, but apps like **Google Authenticator** work too.

4. **Update Contact Info:** Double-check that the account’s contact information is complete and accurate.

5. **Secure Email and Phone Number:** Protect the email and phone associated with the account since they can be used for password resets.

6. **Monitor Root Activities:** Set up alerts and monitoring for all actions performed by the root user.

7. **Two-Person Rule:** For organizations, split root access credentials and MFA between two people. If you’re using a personal account, you can skip this.

8. **Limit Root Use:** Only use the root account when absolutely necessary, which should be very rare.

9. **Regular Checks:** Periodically test your credentials and ensure monitoring and alerting systems are functioning properly.

10. **Incident Response Plan:** Have a plan ready in case the root account is compromised. A detailed playbook will be shared in a future blog.

By following these steps, you’ll significantly strengthen your AWS root account security.

## Creating admin user

Since using the root user for most tasks isn’t recommended, let’s create an `admin` user. Head over to the IAM Dashboard and click on the **“Create user”** button in the top-right corner.

Give the user a username, such as `administrator` or `breakglass` (both are commonly recommended). Check the box for `I want to create an IAM user`. For the console password, select `Autogenerated password`, which will prompt the user to set a new password upon signing in.

### Permissions

Now, let’s set up permissions for this user. It’s best to add the user to a group, though you can also copy permissions or attach policies directly. While attaching policies directly works, using groups is a better practice. Create a new group, give it a name like `administrator`, and search for and select the `AdministratorAccess` policy.

Once that’s done, proceed and click **Create user** to finish.

## Authenticating as the admin user

Once the Now, log out of the console and log back in using your new `admin user.

This should be the last time you’ll use the `root` account, except for rare situations or to occasionally check that the credentials are still valid. From here on out, unless stated otherwise, we won’t be using the `root` account for anything.

## Conclusion

You’ve now secured root, and ready to move forward.
